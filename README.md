![Nether Water](https://github.com/ceskyDJ/NetherWater/blob/master/other/logo.png "Nether Water logo")

Simple [Spigot plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nether-water-enable-water-in-nether-worlds.79256/) that allows players to use water in nether worlds. They can use buckets, ice blocks and dispensers for spawning water.

This is a fork of [KlutzyBubbles/NetherWater](https://github.com/KlutzyBubbles/NetherWater) repository.

## Dependencies
- [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit/) (optional) - if you use WorldEdit, world changes are linked to this
  plugin (creating or deleting water blocks)
- [WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard/) (optional) - if you need to integrate its protection system
- [BKCommonLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bkcommonlib.39590/) (optional) - for modifying mobs' behaviour

This is only NetherWater's direct dependencies! For the right functionality
you need some other plugins (for example WorldEdit for WorldGuard). Read dependency
information on individual plugins' pages, please.

Optional dependencies aren't needed but if you don't provide them,
some NetherWater's functionality will be turned off.
